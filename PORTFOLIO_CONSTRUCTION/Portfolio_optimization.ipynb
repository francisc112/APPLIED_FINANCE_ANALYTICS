    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "This notebook begins the **Portfolio Optimization Project** by analyzing the statistical properties of both the **individual securities** and the **overall portfolio**. The purpose is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the data**: Before applying optimization techniques, we need to explore the underlying behavior of the assets in terms of returns, risk, and correlations.  \n",
    "2. **Establish baselines**: These descriptive statistics will serve as benchmarks against which optimization and constraints can be evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Ingest and clean price data from Financial Modeling Prep\n",
    "- Compute **daily log returns** and derive annualized metrics.  \n",
    "- Perform statistical analysis at both the **asset level** and **portfolio level**:  \n",
    "  - Expected return  \n",
    "  - Volatility (standard deviation)  \n",
    "  - Sharpe ratio (with constant risk-free rate)  \n",
    "  - Skewness & kurtosis  \n",
    "  - Correlation matrix\n",
    "  - Sortino Ratio\n",
    "  - Appraisal Ratio\n",
    "- Visualize key results using plots and tables.  \n"
